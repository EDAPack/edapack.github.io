# Developer Guide

How the edapack build & release system works, and how to build, release, and
extend the tool packages (`verilator-bin`, `yosys-bin`, `iverilog-bin`,
`icestorm-bin`, `nextpnr-bin`, …).

## What the build system guarantees

Every binary release produced by the edapack pipeline provides:

1. **A release manifest** (`manifest.json`) recording the exact versions/commits
   of the core source and every tracked dependency that went into the build.
2. **Change-gated weekly releases** — a scheduled build only publishes when an
   input component actually changed since the last release.
3. **Reproducible pinned builds** — any tool can be built at a specific core
   version (e.g. Verilator `v5.038`) on demand.
4. **Rootless local builds** — developers reproduce the manylinux build locally
   without writing root-owned files into the workspace, with a one-command
   cleanup.
5. **A shipped `export.envrc`** — extracted releases drop their `bin/` onto
   `PATH` via direnv.
6. **Shipped Agent Skills** — every release carries the tool's `skills/` so
   agents can drive it.

## How it fits together

        GitHub Release:  <tool>-<platform>-<version>.tar.gz  +  manifest.json
```

The shared logic lives once in
[`edapack-common`](https://github.com/edapack/edapack-common); tool repos stay
thin and declarative. CI consumes it as a reusable workflow; local builds
consume it as a sibling checkout.

This guide is being written alongside the rollout of the centralized build
system. Pages marked *(planned)* describe behavior that is implemented in
`edapack-common` and being adopted by the tool repos phase by phase.
